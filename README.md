# TuneTribe 🎧

> Because who needs another music app? Apparently, we all do.

Welcome to **TuneTribe**—the web app that lets you search for songs, preview tracks, and bask in the glory of a slick UI, all powered by the Spotify API (via the magical Nocode API).  
Built with React and Vite, styled with Bootstrap and a sprinkle of custom CSS, and deployed to Vercel faster than you can say "skip intro."

## 🚀 Live Demo

Try it, break it, love it: [https://tune-tribe.smyweb.xyz](https://tune-tribe.smyweb.xyz/)

## 📋 Features

- **🔍 Search for Tracks:** Type basically *anything* and get a list of Spotify tracks. (Yes, even “Baby Shark,” but don’t say we didn’t warn you.)
- **🎧 Preview Songs:** Not sure you like it? Sample a short preview before you commit to pretending it’s your favorite.
- **📜 Track Details:** Because who doesn’t love knowing the artist, release date, and seeing that album cover in 400x400 glory?
- **🌐 Responsive Design:** Looks fabulous on mobile, tablet, and probably your smart fridge.
- **🎨 Background Wallpaper:** Enjoy our majestic default background image until you decide to search. (No, you can’t change it. Yet.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite
- **Styling:** Bootstrap, Custom CSS (because vanilla is sometimes the best flavor)
- **API:** Spotify (via [Nocode API](https://nocodeapi.com/))
- **Deployment:** Vercel (because we like things easy)

## 🎤 Installation

Because some people like running things locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tunetribe.git
cd tunetribe
npm install
npm run dev
```
> Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.  
> If it doesn't work, did you try turning it off and on again?

### API Setup

1. Get yourself a [Nocode API](https://nocodeapi.com/) key for Spotify (no, we can't give you ours).
2. Create a `.env` file and add:
    ```
    VITE_SPOTIFY_API_URL=your_nocodeapi_spotify_url
    ```
3. Save, restart, and off you go.
